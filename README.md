The code for the tribute page is available on https://codepen.io/soujanya_gl/pen/dJvYxo.


I have been learning CSS and Bootstrap recently on Freecodecamp and started taking up challenges there. First challenge is to create a simple tribute page with image, text and external links. 

Based on my learning, I created this simple page on CodePen which is dedicted to late APJ Abdul Kalam, a scientist and former President of India. 

It's a straight-forward page written only in CSS and HTML with Bootstrap plugin. 

My learning - 

- Creation of responsive sites using Bootstrap classes. 
- Usage of Bootstrap buttons. 
- Usage of Bootstrap Collapse feature.
- Quickly create tabular structures using CSS grids. 
- Usage of font-awesome icons (which are basically in svg format and considered to be behaved as font).
- How to add CSS to an element using : CSS Class, id attributes. 
- How to add CSS colors :  hexadecimal code (#FFFFFF) (or) color name (white) (or) rgb format [rgb(x,y,z)].
- How to use margin and padding properties of CSS.  
    Margin : Space between element's border and its surrounding element. 
    Padding : Space between the element and its border. 
- Understood how CSS overriding works. 
    Order of precedence of CSS from highest to lowest over an element - !important, inline styling, id (#id {}) styling, class styling (.class {}), parent css. 
- Apply multiple CSS classes to an element. When multiple classes are applied to an element, the css class declared last will take precedence. 

Thanks!
